The wobbling spectra for 163-Lu nuclei is studied with a new formalism in which the four known Triaxial Strongly Deformed bands (i.e., TSD1, TSD2, TSD3, and TSD4) are re-structured in terms of phonon excitations. It is shown that TSD1 and TSD2 are signature partner bands (zero-phonon excitations), TSD3 is the one-phonon excitation built on top of TSD2, and TSD2-TSD4 are Parity Partner Bands. This concept of parity partner bands, which assumes both bands are described by the same wave-function that is invariant to space inversion, is used within a Particle-Rotor-Model. The model gives a semi-classical expression for the total energy of an odd-mass nucleus, and it is used to describe the wobbling spectra for 163-Lu. Moreover, from the conservation laws for the total angular momentum and the total energy, one obtains a set of geometrical representations that give an insight into the actual trajectories of the system as it rotates around a fixed position. The rotational properties of wobbling nuclei are becoming a hot topic nowadays, as it is one of the few fingerprints of triaxiality.
